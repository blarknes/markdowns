## Hints

1. What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

## Solution

Open the website, you'll get another hint:

```txt
Where are the robots?
```

This added to the title and the hint the problem gave us, we know it's referring to the [robots.txt](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/robots.txt) file. There we can find the rule that prevents indexing of a certain URL.

```txt
Disallow: /477ce.html
```

Then simply go to this [URL](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474//477ce.html) and you'll find the flag.
