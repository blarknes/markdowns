## Description

I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website. [http://mercury.picoctf.net:63578/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:63578/)

## Hints

1. Look at the category of this problem.
2. How may a PHP site check the rules in the description?

## Solution

After a lot of googling and trying to make my own pdf files with conflicting md5 hashes as the content, I got to [this website](https://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/) which has two .exe files, hello and erase.

Download these files and change their extension to .pdf, then upload to the flag website, the page will be replaced with the PHP code, there you can find the flag.

```php
<?php

if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {
    $type1 = $_FILES["file1"]["type"];
    $type2 = $_FILES["file2"]["type"];
    $size1 = $_FILES["file1"]["size"];
    $size2 = $_FILES["file2"]["size"];
    $SIZE_LIMIT = 18 * 1024;

    if (($size1 < $SIZE_LIMIT) && ($size2 < $SIZE_LIMIT)) {
        if (($type1 == "application/pdf") && ($type2 == "application/pdf")) {
            $contents1 = file_get_contents($_FILES["file1"]["tmp_name"]);
            $contents2 = file_get_contents($_FILES["file2"]["tmp_name"]);

            if ($contents1 != $contents2) {
                if (md5_file($_FILES["file1"]["tmp_name"]) == md5_file($_FILES["file2"]["tmp_name"])) {
                    highlight_file("index.php");
                    die();
                } else {
                    echo "MD5 hashes do not match!";
                    die();
                }
            } else {
                echo "Files are not different!";
                die();
            }
        } else {
            echo "Not a PDF!";
            die();
        }
    } else {
        echo "File too large!";
        die();
    }
}
