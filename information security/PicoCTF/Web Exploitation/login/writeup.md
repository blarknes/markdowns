## Description

My dog-sitter's brother made this website but I can't get in; can you help?
[login.mars.picoctf.net](login.mars.picoctf.net)

## Hints

- (None)

## Solution

This exercise is another example of the client-side problems, to find the flag all you need to do is go to the scripts of the page, or simply go to [/index.js](https://login.mars.picoctf.net/index.js), and you'll be able to see the validation that the webpage do.  
You can see the **btoa()** and **atob()** functions, with this you know that the username and password are encoded in base64, then simply decrypt the password string and you will get the flag.

```js
console.log(atob("cGljb0NURns1M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyXzUzcnYzcl81M3J2M3JfNTNydjNyfQ"));
```

## Flag

picoCTF{53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r_53rv3r}
