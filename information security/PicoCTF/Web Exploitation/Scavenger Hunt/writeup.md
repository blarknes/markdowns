## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site [http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:5080/). Can you find it?

## Hints

1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

## Solution

Inspect the source code of the website, there you will find the first part of the flag in plain sight:

```html
<!-- Here's the first part of the flag: picoCTF{t -->
```

Then inspect the mycss.css file and you will get the second part of the flag:

```css
/* CSS makes the page look nice, and yes, it also has part of the flag. Here's part 2: h4ts_4_l0 */
```

Following this line of thought, inspecting the myjs.js file you should get the next part of the flag but instead you get a hint for the next clue:

```js
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
```

Doing a quick search on google we get that this file is robots.txt, so going there we get the next part of the flag as well as a clue for the next one:

```txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /index.html
# Part 3: t_0f_pl4c
# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?
```

This one took me quite some time, but after a lot of googling later I got to the .htaccess file, that is one of the apache files that store information. And there we get a part of the flag and a clue:

```txt
# Part 4: 3s_2_lO0k
# I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.
```

This last hint took me quite some time to get as well, but after a lot of googling I got to this [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.DS_Store) and then went to the .DS_Store file as well.  
After this it's just assembling the pieces.
